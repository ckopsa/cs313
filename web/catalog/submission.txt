After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://floating-mountain-98466.herokuapp.com/p03/browse.php

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/coljamkop/cs313/tree/master/web/p03

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
All elements I believe are functioning properly.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
All the required pieces of the assignment are working

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Learning to do AJAX PHP requests was an interesting hurdle that I'm glad I learned about.

6. List one strength and one limitation of using cookies.
Cookies let one track user interactions, which is good.
Although you can track sessions, serious user interaction should use databases and accounts.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
D - Meets requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Although it's not very pretty, it works and I feel I was able to demonstrate the
minimum requirements. I wanted to work more on it, but it took longer than I had
supposed to learn how to properly use AJAX to store things in the PHP session.
